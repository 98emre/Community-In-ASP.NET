# Community-In-ASP.NET
The project involves creating a web application using ASP.NET, C#, MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel), and Entity Framework. It is a simplified version of a community platform where users can send and receive messages. Here are some details about the project:

## Project Tools

**ASP.NET:** Framework for building web applications.
**C#:** Backend programming language.
MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel): A design pattern for separating logic and presentation in a web application.
**Entity Framework:** An object-relational mapping tool (ORM) for working with databases.
**Visual Studio:** An integrated development environment (IDE) for creating and managing ASP.NET projects.
**Git:** A version control system for tracking and managing source code files.
**Web Technologies:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for frontend development).

The project will involve using these tools and technologies to create a functional web application capable of handling user authentication, message management, and potentially group administration depending on the grading level.
